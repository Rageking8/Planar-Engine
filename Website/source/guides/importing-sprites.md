# Importing Sprites

Currently, only Portable Network Graphics (PNG) images are supported. Other image types will be added in the future.

## Add image file to project

Using a file explorer, copy an image to the `Textures` folder in your project.

## Create sprite asset

Navigate to the editor menu bar and click `Asset` > `Asset Import`. Once the asset import window is open, click `Browse` and select the image file previously copied. Next, click `Import` to create the sprite asset. An asset with the same name as the image with a `.planarsprite` extension will be created in that directory.
